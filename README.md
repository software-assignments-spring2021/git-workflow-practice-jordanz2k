[Why JavaScript is Hard to Learn](http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/why-is-javascript-so-hard-to-learn/)

#### Why I like this article

I like this article because simply put, JS has been a difficult concept to grasp for me because everything it is counterintuitive and goes against many rules I learned in my days picking up C, C++, and even Java. First of all, the typing on JavaScript is different (C is static type vs dynamic on JS). Then there are the logic errors that are usually caught in C/Java but JS lets it run and you couldn't figure it out for the light of day.

There are many things to complain about JS, but hopefully through this class I will get better at it!
